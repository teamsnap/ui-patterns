# UI Patterns

A tool for developing, documenting and presenting TeamSnap CSS Components, built with the open-source [Drizzle](https://github.com/cloudfour/drizzle) pattern library tool.

This library includes the [teamsnap-ui](https://github.com/teamsnap/teamsnap-ui) repository of CSS components as a `git submodule`.

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make sure your `node` and `npm` versions are relatively up to date. Node versions as early as v4.2.3 are known to cause issues.
3. `npm start`
